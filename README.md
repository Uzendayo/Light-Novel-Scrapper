# Light Novel Scrapper

Really simple, really...

Main reason behind this is the lack of wifi connection by *Ryanair Airlines*.
Might add more functionality in the future, for now it does what I want it to do, sorry duds.

## Capabilities!
- [x] Grab and save, on a `.json`, all the links of a Novel.
- [x] Download and save the chapters on the `.json`.
- [x] It's saved on a `.json`
- [ ] Can't do much else :/

## Heads up my duds!
Right now the script only works on **some** Novels from [Read Light Novel](https://www.readlightnovel.org).
Will work on it, **Soon™**

## "Installation"
`grab the file :Kappa:`

You will need to `pip` some stuff before running the script.
* `pip install beautifulsoup4`
* `pip install click` it runs on *click* for easier CLI :/

> Btw.. it runs on Python3+

## Getting Started

Run `main.py novel -l -d <novel link>` to save the links and download the chapters on a json.

## Soon™
1. Ability to use it on several Light Novel sites.
2. Saving in *Markdown* format so it's nicer.
3. More functionality.
